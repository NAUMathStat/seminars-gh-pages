The Algebra, Combinatorics, Geometry, and Topology (ACGT) Seminar meets on Tuesdays at 12:45-2:00pm in room 164 of the Adel Mathematics Building.

# Schedule Spring 2015 #

Note that talks are listed in reverse chronological order.

### Groups with all order subsets dividing the order of the group ###

**Dates:** February 17, 2015

**Speaker:** Bret Benesh (College of Saint Benedict & Saint John's University)

**Abstract:** Consider the symmetric group $S_3$ acting on three letters.  It has one element of order $1$, three elements of order $2$, and two elements of order $3$.  Notice that for each order, the number of elements of that order (one, three, and two, respectively) divides the order of the group, which is $3!=6$.  This is not always true, as there are two elements of order $3$ in $\mathbb{Z}_3$.  Groups with this property are called "perfect order subset groups," or POS groups.  We will discuss the basics of POS groups and some classification theorems about POS groups.

### Symmetries of tetravalent metacirculant graphs of type III ###

**Dates:** February 3, February 10, February 24, 2015

**Speaker:** Ben Lantz (NAU)

**Abstract:** I will discuss my thesis work done with Dr. Wilson last spring and examine symmetries in metacirculant graphs and what a metacirculant graph is. I'll talk about how Linking Ring structures are used to help classify these graphs. Then I'll focus on some of the problems and questions that we encountered during our research.

### The Orlik-Solomon algebra: differential forms and cohomology ###

**Dates:** January 20, January 27, 2015

**Speaker:** Michael Falk (NAU)

**Abstract:** We give a short proof of the isomorphism of the Orlik-Solomon algebra of a complex arrangement with an algebra of differential forms, and of the latter with the (De Rham) cohomology of the complement. As a corollary of the latter isomorphism, the complement is a formal space (in the sense of Sullivan). The proof uses a long exact sequence from elementary algebraic topology and the no-broken-circuit basis of the OS algebra.
