title: Applied Mathematics Seminar
---
The AMS typically meets 12:45-1:45PM on Thursdays in Room 164.  Any faculty, students, or friends of the department are welcome to attend. Seminar talks are typically rotated between faculty (and on occasion students or visitors) with research interests related to applied mathematics, widely defined to include almost anything from ordinary and partial differential equations, dynamical systems, nonlinear and linear functional analysis, numerical analysis, optimization, operations research, scientific computing, modeling, and advanced physics. If you are interested/willing to give a talk, please contact [John.Neuberger@nau.edu](mailto:John.Neuberger@nau.edu), Colloquium Chair and AMS Coordinator, Spring 2015.

## Tentative Schedule ##

- 1/15 Organizational Meeting
- 1/22 Neuberger - Decimation for Eigenvalue/Eigenvector Generation
- 1/29 Cancelled
- 2/5 Wolford
- 2/12 Neuberger - Decimation Part II, Sierpinski Gasket
- 2/19 Brighton - Kevin can use another 45 minutes - to - one hour to finish up on his topic:

"First Eigenvalue Estimates for Manifolds with Ricci Curvature Bounded from Below."

Abstract:  I'll begin with a (very) brief introduction to Riemannian geometry and some of the intuition involved in comparison geometry.  I'll then prove the classical first eigenvalue estimate of Lichnerowicz for manifolds with positive Ricci curvature and Zhong-Yang's improvement of Li-Yau's estimate for manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature.  If time permits, I will conclude with a discussion of a conjecture of Li concerning the combination of these two results into a single unified estimate.


## Future Talks ##

- Blows - student project, Theobold
- Schulz - Yang Mills?
